# PortfolioWeb
This is going to be my personal open-source web portfolio for anyone who wants to use it as a template. Currently, it's purely frontend, but the idea is to have each work section's article added based on GitHub pins, and the information can be modified either through a JSON or a graphical interface. As you can see in the screenshot, I'm aiming for a minimalist style that aligns with my personal preferences.

Actually, I don't recommend using this one... It's pretty bad.
